        Annoyed of forgetting your access data for hundreds of services, apps and co.?

        Do you want a secure way of saving all your passwords instead of writing them down on a sheet of paper?

        Password Locker is your solution! It stores and manages all entered data in an encrypted way, so you have a secure storage of your access data and you only have to remember your master-password.

        You can trust Password Locker as it does not have any access to the internet. Password Locker uses AES 256-bit encryption to secure your data.

        If you want to use the data, upload it to Dropbox (or similar) and import it from there on another device."</string>
